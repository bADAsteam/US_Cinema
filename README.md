The central focus of this project is to thoroughly analyze movie summaries, which hold a vast amount of information about movie characters. In addition to examining the <strong> importance </strong> of characters depending on their gender, we will also delve into the difference of presence according to the genre. Through the analysis of summaries, we can gain a deeper understanding of the description of physical and mental characteristics and actions of male and female characters in the film industry, as well as any potential lexical fields that could differentiate them. The idea is to see the evolution of the gender bias over time and to quantify this gap. 
An additional focus is to explore the influence of women characters on the success of a film with the public. From there, it will be possible to put in parallel the point of view of the spectator and the point of view of the director.
