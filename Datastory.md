In 1975, the filmmaker Laura Muley highlighted the underrepresentation of women in film industry and more broadly in visual culture. She introduced the term "male gaze" and allow people to question the place of women in the cinema industry. The American cinema industry played a strong role on the western society and appears as a good area of study to examine how women's representation has changed over the period of nearly a century. It would be interesting to first examine the underlying distinctions between men and women's presence in a movie. Specifically, to investigate the ages of the actors and actresses as well as the roles' percentage of occupations. Then, we will explore the representation of women in front of the camera. In fact, by examining the roles they play, one might gain an understanding of how the director stages them.

How has the women places evolves in the US cinema industry ? Does the cinema represent more men than women and has there been a change over the years ? Has the role played by woman and the attributes of their characters evolves through the year ? And finally how the place of actresses evolve for the public ?

## The world of cinema through American eyes ?

Thanks to a preliminary study, it has been chosen to focus on American movies in the global cinema industry. This focus is appropriate for this case because Hollywood has produced half of the movies made worldwide and has the largest pool of acting talent.
